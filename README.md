# Factorio.Modding.Api.NET
C# clone of Factorio modding api for Lua, for now it supports only prototype stage.

## Package
https://www.nuget.org/packages/Factorio.Modding.Api/#readme-body-tab

This repository was an experiment if cloning the Factorio API and then creating a Lua serializer for it was viable. I decided that it was not a good approach and different tools can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/AiwendilsCode/Factorio.NET).
